Quick Start
All scenes are placed in the Scene directory. Every scene I baked Navmesh to provide pathfinding. 
You can delete the baking information yourself. In addition, after the scene is running,
 you can use the arrow keys on the keyboard to move the object to visit the scene.
The boundaries of the scene are not specifically occluded, you need to add a view of the border with things like skyboxes or fog.
